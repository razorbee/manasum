<h6 class="testiomonial-width">We came across a news paper ad. in July 2018 right after our return from USA. After initial talks about the upcoming project and getting convinced, straight away decided to go in for a retirement home and gave an initial deposit of Rs.2 lakh on the spot even before a visit to the site. We usually don't take such fast decisions that too on a retirement home costing about Rs.35 lakh. But after initial discussions with the project team, we were confident that we are dealing with a professional team. Visited the project site a couple of times since then and hopeful that we will get possession of our sweet/little home by year end as promised. All safety features, especially keeping in mind senior citizens requirements have been addressed. Overall, we are happy and contended that we have invested in a safe and good project to spend later years of our lives.</h6>
